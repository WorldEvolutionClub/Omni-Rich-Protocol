## Overview
The Omni-Rich Protocol is a decentralized, blockchain/hypergraph–based digital monetary system designed to provide universal financial security through **value-based issuance** rather than debt-based money creation.  
The system operates as a **non-sovereign economic layer**, governed by transparent rules and decentralized consensus rather than central banks.

This concept note summarizes the mechanism design, architecture, and open research questions.

## 1. Problem Statement
Traditional monetary systems depend on:
- debt issuance  
- interest-bearing credit  
- taxation  
- centralized control  
- employment-linked income stability  

These structures create global financial precarity, inequality, and fragility—especially under accelerating automation and AI-driven labor transitions.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution
The Omni-Rich Protocol issues digital currency according to **People Equity** — verified human contribution, participation, and real economic value creation.

Key innovations:
- value-linked issuance  
- protocol-level wage funding  
- demurrage-driven velocity stabilization  
- offline-first digital payments  
- universal homeownership grant  
- cooperative capitalism structure  
- 6-4-8 labor framework (6-hour days, 4-day weeks, 8 weeks vacation)

---

## 3. Mechanism Design

### 3.1 Value-Based Issuance (“People Equity”)
New currency is issued when:
- productive work is verified  
- goods/services are provided  
- societal needs require resource allocation  

### 3.2 Protocol-Level Wage Funding (“Value Pay”)
Baseline income is issued by the protocol, not employers:
> **Baseline wages are issued at the protocol layer, independent of employer revenue.**

### 3.3 Demurrage for Velocity
To maintain economic flow:
- a portion of unused monthly Value Pay expires after 90 days  
- only affects new issuances  
- long-term savings remain untouched

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Offline-First Digital Payments
- solar-powered smart debit cards  
- NFC/Bluetooth P2P transactions  
- e-ink balance display  
- local encrypted ledger  
- periodic blockchain/hypergraph sync  

### **Concept Prototype**

### 4.2 Consensus Layer
- blockchain/hypergraph hybrid  
- hashgraph-style fast finality  
- quantum-resistant cryptography  
- offline-to-online reconciliation  

---

## 5. Economic Logic
- Universal homeownership grant  
- Cooperative capitalism (collaboration between firms)  
- 6-4-8 labor structure  
- Stable purchasing power via value-matched issuance  
- Wealth-ceiling rules to prevent concentration  

---

## 6. Governance
- decentralized governance  
- transparent issuance parameters  
- public-goods alignment  
- open research on incentive design  

---

## 7. Open Research Questions
- issuance modeling  
- demurrage macro behavior  
- identity and anti-fraud systems  
- transition dynamics  
- scaling  
- consensus governance
